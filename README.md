<h1>Hi, I'm Oti!</h1>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Bit About myself</h2>
I never thought debugging a semicolon at 3 AM could spark joy, yet here I am, thrilled to write you about my passion for turning caffeine and code into meaningful software solutions. As a Computer Science student at <strong>E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University</strong>, I‚Äôve spent countless hours wrestling with algorithms, building projects, and occasionally celebrating when my code runs on the first try (a rare but glorious moment). 


Jokes aside, my name is <strong>Otar Jintchveladze</strong>, a driven and passionate young computer scientist with a goal to not just write code, but to truly program with purpose. I invite you to explore my personal portfolio at <strong>www.otarjinchveladze.com.</strong> While it doesn‚Äôt cover everything, it offers a glimpse into my work. If you'd like to learn more or discuss my expertise, feel free to reach out via email at <strong>otarjinchveladze@gmail.com</strong>. I'd be happy to share more!
